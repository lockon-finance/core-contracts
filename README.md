# LOCKON Core Contract Repository 
Fork of the [SetProtocol/set-protocol-v2](https://github.com/SetProtocol/set-protocol-v2) project. 
This repository contains modifications and added features that are specially designed to meet our unique needs and requirements.

## Contracts
[Set Protocol](https://setprotocol.com/) is a specification for tokenized asset management strategies on the ethereum blockchain written in the Solidity programming language. We use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) as a development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying our contracts.
